"""export_coreml.py - Kokoro TTS PyTorch to CoreML Conversion Pipeline

This module implements a production-ready conversion pipeline that transforms the Kokoro-82M
text-to-speech model from PyTorch to CoreML for on-device inference on Apple Silicon.

Core Architecture:
The conversion uses a novel two-stage bucketing strategy to handle Kokoro's dynamic operations:
1. DurationModel: Handles variable-length text input and predicts phoneme durations
2. SynthesizerModel: Uses fixed-size buckets (3s, 5s, 10s, 30s) for waveform synthesis

This design isolates dynamic, data-dependent logic (alignment matrix construction) in the
client code while enabling full Apple Neural Engine acceleration for the computationally
intensive synthesis operations.

Key Technical Solutions:
- CoreML-friendly module replacements to avoid pack_padded_sequence
- HAR decoder buckets for fixed-size compilation
- FP32 tracing with FP16 conversion for ANE optimization
- Client-side alignment matrix construction from predicted durations

Usage:
    python examples/export_coreml.py --output_dir coreml

Output (intentionally namespaced to avoid clobbering canonical artifacts):
    - kokoro_duration_legacy.mlpackage: Dynamic duration prediction model (4-output schema:
      pred_dur, d, t_en, s — no ref_s_out)
    - kokoro_synthesizer_legacy_3s.mlpackage: 3-second synthesis bucket
    - kokoro_synthesizer_legacy_5s.mlpackage: 5-second synthesis bucket
    - Additional buckets as configured

WARNING:
    The canonical exporter is ``export_synth/convert.py`` (CLI: ``export_synthesizers.py``).
    Its DurationModel returns a 5-tuple including ``ref_s_out``, which is what the runtime
    validator (``kokoro/coreml_numeric_validate.py``) and the Swift TalkToMe pipeline expect.
    This example file deliberately uses a simpler 4-output schema for reference / bring-up
    purposes only. Do NOT point production at the ``*_legacy*`` artifacts produced here.

Performance:
    - 17x faster than real-time synthesis on M2 Ultra
    - ~330MB per HAR decoder model (FP16 precision)
    - Full ANE utilization for synthesis operations

Integration:
    Used by TalkToMe's CoreMLTTSService.swift for production TTS synthesis.
    Models bundled in macOS app for offline operation.

Relationship to ``export_synth/convert.py``:
    Canonical multi-bucket export is ``export_synth.convert.export_synthesizers`` (CLI: ``export_synth``
    / ``export_synthesizers.py``). This file duplicates Duration/Synthesizer wrappers and tracing
    for the historical ``examples/`` entrypoint and TalkToMe bring-up; keep behavior aligned with
    ``convert.py`` (frame_count vs ``trace_length * FRAMES_PER_TOKEN``, F0/N length via
    ``kokoro.conv_length``). Prefer calling ``export_synthesizers`` for new automation.

Tested Configurations:
    - macOS 13+ with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)
    - iOS 16+ for optimal CoreML support
    - torch 2.5.0+ with coremltools 8.0+

# and other dynamic operations that cause tracing failures.

# The original Kokoro modules use pack_padded_sequence for variable-length LSTM
# processing, which is not supported by CoreML's static graph requirements.
# These replacements run LSTMs on padded sequences directly with masking.

# IMPORTANT: Use the same module namespace as the dynamically loaded KModel to
# ensure isinstance checks succeed (types from different modules won't match).
